/** Permutation Sequence

The set [1,2,3,â€¦,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,
We get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3):

"123"
"132"
"213"
"231"
"312"
"321"
Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

Note: Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.

    /**
     * The permutation sequence is following a simple law, e.g.,
     * if n = 3, then all sequences are divided to 3 groups, because the number
     * of all sequences is 3!=6, then each group will have 2 sub-sequences.
     * Meanwhile, in each group, they will have same first char, and following the
     * order from low to high(1,2,3).
     * 
     * So if given n = 3, k = 4, we will know that the sequence will located in the
     * second group, and the first char is '2'; then can shrink the question to
     * n = 3-1 = 2, k = 4 - 2 * 1 =2, that is to say, the second sequence of '13'
     * can produce.
     *
     * When n = 2, there are 2!=2 all possible sequences and 2 groups, so in each
     * group only have one, and the first char of first group is '1', the first char of
     * second group is  '3'.
